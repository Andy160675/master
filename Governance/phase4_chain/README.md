# Phase 4 — Chain Substrate (Scaffold)

Purpose:
- Provide the trust substrate for permanence and verification.
- Keep the system verifiable even when copied/mirrored.

Scope (scaffold-only):
- Hash-chain conventions for JSONL ledgers
- Anchoring/export formats (Merkle/anchor bundles) for future decentralization

Invariants:
- Chain is append-only.
- Verification must be deterministic and reproducible.
