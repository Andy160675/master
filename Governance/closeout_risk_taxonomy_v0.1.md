# CLOSEOUT — Risk Taxonomy v0.1

## Status
CLOSED — GOVERNANCE ARTIFACT SEALED

## Artifact
- Name: RISK_TAXONOMY_v0.1.md
- Location: /Governance/
- Type: Constitutional Governance Spec
- Activation State: Defined / Not Active

## Authority
- Owner: Sovereign Governance Layer
- Applies To: All autonomy routing, organisation response constraints, and executive review logic
- Supersedes: Implicit or narrative risk interpretation

## Binding Declaration
Risk Taxonomy v0.1 is the **sole permitted source** for deriving:
- `risk_level`
- `risk_band`
- risk-based routing eligibility

No component (human or agent) may:
- Infer risk informally
- Override risk classification ad hoc
- Substitute legal, emotional, or narrative judgment for taxonomy output

Any future change requires:
- New version (v0.2+)
- Explicit changelog
- Separate seal event

## Non-Activation Notice
This artifact:
- Does NOT activate autonomy
- Does NOT enable response actions
- Does NOT alter existing policy enforcement

It exists to **eliminate ambiguity**, not to trigger execution.

## Forward Dependencies (Not Executed)
- Organisation Response Protocol v0.1 (must consume `risk_level`)
- Autonomy Resolver v0.1 (must consume `risk_level`)

## Close Condition
This governance unit is considered complete and immutable
until explicitly superseded by a higher-version artifact.
