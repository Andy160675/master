# IDE Shared Folder

This folder is intended as a **shared scratch/exchange area** between IDEs (e.g., VS Code + JetBrains) when they open the same repository.

Typical uses:
- Temporary notes while debugging
- Shared snippets / scratch files
- Generated one-off artifacts you do *not* want committed

By default, everything in this folder is ignored by git except this README and the local `.gitignore`.
