## 1. Canonical Layer Model

The long-term governance target is a layered model with strict separation of function:

| Layer | Canonical Name | Operational Alias | Industry Analogue |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| L0 | Human Accountability & Authority | Accountable Officer | Responsible Person |
| L1 | Context Preservation & Decision Support | Paperclip | Decision Support System (DSS) |
| L2 | Hard Constraint Enforcement | Sentinel | Safety Interlocks / Control Gates |
| L3 | Retrospective Analysis & Drift Detection | Watchtower | Audit / QA / Risk Monitoring |
| L4 | Separation of Authority, Function, and Tempo | *(invariant)* | Segregation of Duties |
| L5 | Process Conformance Attestation | Sovereign Seal | Conformance Attestation |
| L6 | Evidence, Ledger, and Memory Integrity | Ledger | Audit Trail / Records Management |

**Layer invariants:**

- L0: A named human is always accountable for outcomes.
- L1: Assistance must never imply approval.
- L2: Some constraints are binary and non-discretionary.
- L3: Patterns are assessed retrospectively, not acted on in real time.
- L4: No single component may assist, observe, and enforce.
- L5: Conformance is not approval.
- L6: Assertions without evidence do not exist.

**One-sentence summary:**
Rubber Stamp preserves context, Watchtower preserves alignment, Sentinel preserves
boundaries, and the Sovereign Seal attests conformance — all under explicit human
accountability.

## 2. Procurement Readiness Assessment

**Assessment:** The architecture does not meet the minimum standard for issuing an
RFP within a UK public procurement context.

**Reason:** Requirements are expressed as philosophical principles rather than defined
services, creating unbounded scope, unpriceable risk, and unverifiable outcomes.

**Required remediation before market engagement:**

1. **Define the service boundary** — functional service catalogue, user volumes,
   performance targets, data classifications
2. **Establish accountable governance** — decision authority, statutory basis,
   stewardship definitions, escalation routes
3. **Make compliance architecturally coherent** — record permanence vs rectification,
   retention schedules, lawful processing basis, erasure mechanisms
4. **Replace product preferences with standards** — interoperability requirements,
   portability expectations, open standards baseline, substitution criteria
5. **Produce a compliant commercial pack** — security classification, service
   management model, transition/exit plan, evaluation methodology, pricing structure

**Strategic sequence:**
1. Approve operating model
2. Define services and outcomes
3. Run pre-market engagement
4. Issue structured RFP

## 3. QMS Chapter Structure

Proposed 12-chapter QMS binding the governance architecture:

1. Purpose, Scope and Authority
2. Governance Operating Model
3. Decision Support System (DSS) — Operational Control
4. Safety Interlocks / Control Gates (Sentinel)
5. Audit and Drift Monitoring (Watchtower)
6. Segregation of Duties Framework
7. Conformance Attestation (Sovereign Seal)
8. Records, Evidence and Ledger Management
9. Risk, Compliance and Assurance Integration
10. Service Management and Change Control
11. Training and Competence
12. Continuous Assurance and Review

## 4. RFP Analysis

**Source:** Draft RFP from Tom Maher (WhatsApp, 15/02/2026)

**Assessment:** Vision statement dressed as an RFP for a transparency-driven digital
governance platform. Useful as a concept brief — not yet robust enough for formal
market engagement.

**Red flags:**
- Unpriceable scope (no service catalogue, no volumes, no NFRs)
- Governance without an owner (stewardship roles lack statutory footing)
- Compliance contradiction (immutable records vs reversibility, no retention model)
- Technology shopping list without architectural standards
- Missing mandatory procurement content

**Recommended next steps:**
- Reframe to outcomes and services
- Establish operating model first
- Resolve data policy
- Standardise technical baseline
- Make it commercially executable

## 5. AI HR Charter

**Purpose:** Ensure AI in workforce management supports human judgement, operates
lawfully, and produces explainable, reviewable, contestable decisions.

**Foundational invariant:**
AI may inform employment decisions. Humans remain accountable for them.

**Scope:** Recruitment, performance, workforce planning, L&D, employee relations,
policy administration.

**Key principles:**

1. **Non-delegable human accountability** — named accountable manager per outcome
2. **Lawfulness** — UK GDPR, DPA 2018, equality/employment law, mandatory DPIAs
3. **Fairness** — bias testing, outcome monitoring, documented limitations
4. **Transparency** — clear communication of where/how AI is used
5. **Decision support boundary** — AI may synthesise, identify patterns, check
   consistency; AI may NOT make autonomous decisions, infer behaviour without
   lawful basis, covertly monitor, or determine disciplinary outcomes
6. **Auditability** — decision traceability, model version control, override logs
7. **Supplier governance** — contractual transparency, audit rights, exit provisions
8. **Workforce rights** — explanation, human reconsideration, data correction

**Oversight:** HR Director (operational), DPO (legal), independent assurance (periodic).

**Enduring statement:**
AI in HR exists to support people, not to manage them. Authority remains human.

## 6. Companion Role Evolution

The "Paperclip" concept went through several naming iterations:

- **Paperclip** — original name, reclaimed from the AI safety thought experiment.
  Meant as "the useful MS Clippy that never got promoted and never wanted to."
- **Rubber Stamp** — proposed alias, rejected due to cultural baggage implying
  approval/endorsement.
- **Paperclip** — retained as operational alias for Layer 1.

**Definition:**
A persistent, context-aware assistant that does not decide, does not command, does
not escalate itself, and never becomes important. It exists to notice, nudge, remind,
surface inconsistencies, ask the annoying-but-right question, then shut up again.

**Three-role separation (the key insight):**
- Paperclip must never become Sentinel
- Sentinel must never become Paperclip
- Watchtower must never act in real time

---

## 7. Pranus

**Definition:** The ambient pressure field that bends governance systems.

**Components:**
- Urgency, deadlines
- Narrative capture, optics
- "Just this once"
- Convenience drift
- Seniority bias
- Institutional gravity

**Containment model:**
- Paperclip makes pressure visible
- Watchtower measures pressure over time
- Sentinel blocks pressure at boundaries

**Not a layer.** A named failure mode / environmental factor.

---

## 8. HARLS Theory Placement

**Status in repo:** Not present (no code, no spec file).

**Correct placement:** Measurement substrate above the layers, not a layer itself.

**What HARLS defines:**
- Harls Rate — information preserved per transformation interval
- Coherence Ratio — proportion of input information retained
- Stage coherence, end-to-end coherence, path independence
- Drift as a measurable signal

**Relationship to layers:**
- Justifies Layer 1 (context preservation = information survival)
- Defines Layer 2 thresholds (coherence below minimum = Sentinel trigger)
- Supplies Layer 3 math (drift = gradual coherence decay)

**Current status:** Conceptually referenced, not operationally present.

---

## 9. Sanctuary Layer Concept

**Status:** Not implemented. Conceptual only.

**Definition:** A bounded operational context in which human welfare is prioritised
over throughput, optimization, or efficiency. A governance mode, not a safe space.

**Activation conditions:** Children/vulnerable persons, safeguarding, trauma exposure,
coercion risk, asymmetric power, irreversible personal harm risk.

**Effects:** Tightens existing layer constraints (lower Sentinel thresholds, increased
Watchtower scrutiny, slower Paperclip cadence). Does not add new powers.

## 10. Named Constructs

### HARLS (constraint profile)
- Lives under Sentinel (Layer 2) as predefined safeguard profiles
- Not a role, not an agent — a named bundle of non-negotiable constraints
- Governs: child safety, safeguarding, vulnerable persons, high-liability contexts

### St Michael (doctrine)
- Lives under Layer 4 (Separation of Authority)
- Anti-power-creep doctrine: no authority may self-justify, self-expand, or self-override
- Invoked during audits, retrospectives, architecture reviews
- Not enforcement — a review checklist and Watchtower lens
